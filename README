Math-Geometry-Delaunay

This is a Perl interface to Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle library.

alpha release - not thoroughly tested

"Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay 
triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and 
high-quality triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or 
large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis." 
-- from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

This Perl wrapper provides convenient methods for adding polygons, polylines,
segments and points as input for Triangle, and for accessing triangulation
results topologically, or as simple lists of triangles, edges, or points.

This XS module includes Triangle version 1.6.
